It shows you all the features and goes into details about the various elements exposed by each feature.  This is a great way to verify that the right configurations have been exposed.

You can also drill down into the plugins and see its contained elements. This is especially useful the _Content_ and _Analytics_ plugins.

In future versions, we will make this more extensible and allow every feature and plugin to provide its own information views, in addition to the standard details.
