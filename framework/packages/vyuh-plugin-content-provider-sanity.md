# Vyuh Plugin Content Provider Sanity

[Sanity.io](https://sanity.io) is the default CMS that is used by the Vyuh framework. This provider allows you to fetch documents from a Sanity dataset using GROQ queries and render them using the Vyuh framework.

Internally, the provider uses the [Sanity Client](https://pub.dev/packages/sanity\_client) for its configuration and makes connections to the Sanity CDN.
